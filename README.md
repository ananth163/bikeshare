# Bikeshare project
Final Project done as part of Udacity Python Foundations Nanodegree

<b>Introduction</b>

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, we will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by <a href="https://www.motivateco.com/">Motivate</a>, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. We will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. We will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

<b> Analysis performed on the bikeshare data </b>
<ol>
<li>How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?</li>
<b>Result:</b> Monthly and Seasonal ridership plots are shown below. The system is having highest ridership in Fall season especially on September. During winter season, there is almost negligible usage by Customers causing Subscriber to Customer ratio high. Customer and Subscriber usage is high during Summer and Fall seasons. Customer ridership is more on August and Subscriber ridership is more on September<br>
<li>Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?</li>
<b>Result:</b> Ridership pattern is different on weekends and weekdays Subscribers most likely use the system on Weekdays and Customers on Weekends. Average duration of rides depend on day of week and is usually more on weekends

<li>During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?</li>
<b>Result:</b> System is used the most at 18'o clock. The usage pattern is different for subscribers and customers. Subscribers use the system most at 9-10'0 clock and 18-20'o clock which corresponds to office commute hours while customers use it the most at 11-18'0 clock corresponding to tourist hours
